Changelog
=========

1.0 (unreleased)
------------------

- Add some basic theming for AJAX-included HTML for Plone.
  [davidjb]
- Adjust all themes to only apply theming rules when ``visual-portal-wrapper``
  is present.  Previously, xi:includes were causing other non-content
  Plone resources to be themed (such as TinyMCE HTML pages, which broke
  the visual editor).
  [davidjb]
- Modify all CSS and JS resources to use Plone's ``base`` variable, supplied
  by plone.app.theming. Without this, relative URLs result in the same resources
  being loaded on different URLs for every page request.
  [davidjb]
- Modify all theme CSS to use relative paths to Plone's shared
  Bootstrap theme resources.  See README for more information.
  [davidjb]
- Add upgrade script to pull latest versions from Bootswatch.
  [davidjb]
- Fix typo in name of Amelia theme.
  [davidjb]
- Ensure CSS included in themes via Diazo rules is not escaped.
  This previously rendered ">" characters as their HTML entity in CSS.
